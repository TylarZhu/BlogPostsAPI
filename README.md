Hello Dear Interviewer,

My name is Xingyuan (Tylar) Zhu. I am a Computer Science student specializing in the software engineering stream at the University of Toronto. I have a great passion for making backend web development, and I have more than four years of hands-on experience. I am excited to have the opportunity to do this assessment because it shows my skills and I learned a lot from it. Please, if you are interested in me, I'd love to communicate with you!

Sorry about submitting this assessment late because I have to finish my school work before graduation day, April 29th. Please allow me to introduce how to run my code.

First, install all the packages needed:

```
npm i --save
```

To run app.js:

```
node .\app.js
```

To run tests (app.test.js) on app.js:

```
npm run test
```

Thank you for taking the time to look at my code. ðŸ˜†

Sincerely,

Xingyuan Zhu
